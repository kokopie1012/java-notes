# 14: OOP Again

[Questions: 14](14%20OOP%20Again%2036505ba6a71149ea973b82ff55e77c15/Questions%2014%20c88707d4e5b64e61a3d947c1871ae22b.md)

To check whether an object is an instance of some class : 

```java
Pet **instanceof** Animal // Returns true
Pet **instanceof** Bird // Returns false

// Also
Pet myPet = new Pet("Parakeet");
myPet **instanceof** Pet // true
myPet **instanceof** Animal // true
```

```java
// String.format() for formatted text
{
	return String.format("The make of the model is %s from the year %d", make, year);
}
```

If you try to print a class with `System.out.println(ClassName)` - it will print memory locations etc. To convert it into a string representation a class should have a `toString` method.

```java
class ClassName {
	
	public String toString() {
		return String.format("The make of the model is %s from the year %d", make, year);
	}

}

// Now the following line prints the value returned by the toString method
System.out.println(ClassName);
```

> You need to think how a consumer (programmer etc) would be using the API.

## Object Composition

One object is part of another. Here Address field is an object of type Address which we create seperately.

```java
class Customer {
	String name;
	**Address** customerAddress;
}
```

A field inside a class can be of any type. In the following code listing all the reviews of a book are stored in an ArrayList of `Reviews` type

```java
class Book {
	
	int bookID;
	String name;
	ArrayList<Reviews> **reviews =** new ArrayList<Reviews>();
	
}
```

## **Inheritance**

Subclass **extends** superclass

```java
public class Student **extends** Person {}
```

! **A class that does not extend anything extends the object class.** This object class is the **root** of the class hierarchy.

```java
class SomeClass extends **Object {}**
```

**Method Overriding**

Like we override the `toString()` method in a class.

We can override ant method in a subclass by just redeclaring and redefining it.

In the following code listing we override the `toString()` method but also call the toString method of the Superclass by using `super()`

```java
public String toString() {
	return **super.toString()** + "Name : " + this.name;
}
```

`**super()**` is called inside the constructor of a subclass implicitly everytime.

```java
public class Student extends Person {

	private int studentId;
	
	public Student(String name, int age, int studentId) {
		**super(name, age);**
		this.studentId = studentId;
	}

}
```

---

In java multiple inheritance is not really supported. In c++ it is.

```java
**// This code listing is invalid**
class Pet extends Animal, Dog {}
```

If Pet extends Animal, then the superclass can hold a subclass variable. Example :

```java
Pet myPet = new Animal();
```

---

## Abstract Class

You don't have to implement all the methods. Can't create instances of an abstract class.

```java
abstract class Dog {
	
	abstract public void bark() {};

}

// Also

abstract class Rancho extends Dog {};
```

If now a class needs to extends an abstract class, it has to provide all the implementations inside the class. **Abstract class** is used to create a **Concrete Class.**

```java
class Rancho extends Dog {
	public void bark() {
		System.out.println("Bow Bow");
	}
}
```

---

## **Interface**

Common actions among classes. Interfaces establish the **contract** between two classes talking to each other. You can't have variables inside intefaces.

```java
public interface GameingConsole {
	public void up();
	public void down();
	public void right();
	public void left);
}
```

```java
public class Mario implements GamingConsole {
	/**/ Implement all the methods defined in the interface.**
}
```

**Polymorphism** with interfaces : 

Depending on which object we want to use, we can get different functionality from the same code. Same code, different actions.

```java
GamingConsole game = new Mario();
GamingConsole game = new Chess();

game.up();
game.down();
game.right();
game.left();
```

An interface can **extend** another interface:

```java
interface Interface1 extends Interface2 {
	// Actions
}
```

To implement an extended interface you need to define and implement all the methods/actions asked by the interfaces.

```java
class Imp implements Interface2 {
	// Implement all the actions in Interface1
	
	// Implement all the actions in Interface2
}
```

But you can have abstract classes that do not implement all the actions. But a concrete class has to.

> **A class can implement multiple interfaces.**

You can provide implementations of methods within the interface itself. If a class doesn't implement the method, it gets the **default** implementation.

```java
interface newInterface {
	**// Default implementation can be overriden.**
	default void sum(int a, int b) {
		return a + b;
	}
}
```

- When you have 2 components/classes talking to each other, have a communication pattern between them, use interface. (Maybe).
